# websocket-demo

This WebSocket is a communication protocol that will establish two-way communication channel between a server and a client.

It functions by first establishing HTTP connection with server and then upgrading to bidirectional websocket connection by sending an upgrade header.

It is well supported in modern browsers as of 2019.
